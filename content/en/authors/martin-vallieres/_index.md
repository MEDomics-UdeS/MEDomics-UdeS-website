Martin Vallières devotes much of his current work to the development of a solution for integrative data modeling in 
oncology. He is leading the development of MEDomicsLab, an open source end-to-end computational platform for 
precision oncology. This platform will integrate heterogeneous data from hospitals using deep learning and machine 
learning methods based on graph theory. By contributing to the improvement of predictive models in oncology, 
MEDomicsLab will become a key artificial intelligence tool in medicine.
