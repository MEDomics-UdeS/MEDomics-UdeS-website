Lyna Hiba Chikouche, a final-year engineering student, completed her final internship at the MedomicsUdes laboratory. The project she worked on aimed to integrate an evaluation layer into the MedomicsLab platform. To achieve this, a package was developed based on two methods: Detectron and Med3pa. This package evaluates an AI model by identifying problematic data profiles where it does not perform well. Additionally, this package tests the robustness of the model against covariate shift, evaluating how changes in the distribution of input data affect its performance.
