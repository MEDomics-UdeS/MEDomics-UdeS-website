With the advancement of modern medicine, a large number of medical encounters (doctor visits, exams, medications, 
imaging, molecular tests, etc.) take place in our healthcare system. In fact, the amount of new global health data 
generated in 2020 is expected to have reached 2,314 exabytes. Most of the content in our hospitals' electronic health 
records (EHRs) is recorded via sparse data tables with a high probability of missing values. Nevertheless, EMRs have a 
large amount of heterogeneous data from different sources, most of which is often not optimally exploited to 
characterize and predict disease behavior. For example, medical imaging (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) would 
be a huge source of potential data to decode cancer phenotypes. 

On the other hand, physicians also describe and write down important patient characteristics and disease-related 
symptoms for almost every medical encounter through free-form medical notes. In recent years, significant advances 
in multi-omics technology (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, etc.) have also created unprecedented opportunities to 
characterize biological processes correlated with disease. However, combining these _heterogeneous data sources_ in a 
meaningful way for disease prediction is challenging. 

Therefore, for better precision medicine, physicians must now make increasingly complex therapeutic decisions with an 
unrealistic number of variables. Therefore, developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are envisioned to create a 
data science revolution in medicine. In particular, _graphical neural networks (GNNs)_ have shown immense potential in 
learning meaningful and powerful data representations by combining the relational inference of graphical models with 
the power of deep learning. However, since the power of deep learning is strongly associated with data size and 
medical data cannot be easily shared among medical institutions due to patient privacy concerns, developing powerful 
GNN models for disease prediction in healthcare is a major challenge.
