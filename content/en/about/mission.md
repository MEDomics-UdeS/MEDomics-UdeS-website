The main mission of the MEDomics UdeS lab is to develop a framework for **privacy-preserving distributed GNN learning 
from a network of federated healthcare databases**, which will be an important step in advancing AI in medicine. In 
this federated learning framework:
<ul>
  <li> (i) GNN models can be developed from the databases of multiple healthcare facilities, thereby increasing the size of the analyzed data; and </li>
  <li> (ii) data are always kept within the boundaries of each healthcare facility, thus avoiding data transfer.</li>
</ul>
  
The figures below provide an overview of the main research framework of the MEDomics UdeS lab.
