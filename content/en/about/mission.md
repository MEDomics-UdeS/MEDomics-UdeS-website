The main mission of the MEDomics UdeS lab is to develop a framework for **privacy-preserving distributed GNN learning 
from a network of federated healthcare databases**, which will be an important step in advancing AI in medicine. In 
this federated learning framework: 
- (i) GNN models can be developed from the databases of multiple healthcare facilities, thereby increasing the size of the analyzed data; and 
- (ii) data are always kept within the boundaries of each healthcare facility, thus avoiding data transfer.

The figures below provide an overview of the main research framework of the MEDomics UdeS lab.
