## Description

In medical imaging, radiomic features are used to characterize the heterogeneity of a region of interest at the 
anatomical level. This way of quantifying the heterogeneity of a region of interest can be useful, for example, to 
identify the most aggressive tumors in oncology. To this end, we hypothesize that the variation of magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) acquisition sequences and its resulting different contrast levels would optimize the subsequent 
radiomic analysis. 

In this project, a real medical image analysis pipeline will first be set up to quantify the robustness of radiomic 
features as a function of variations in acquisition protocols. Then, an MRI acquisition simulation pipeline will be 
developed in order to evaluate the optimization potential of radiomic features in medicine.
