## Description

In the context of a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at a certain time t0, patients are managed until 
the end of treatment at a certain later time t1. In the future, these patients may develop certain problems, such as 
obesity, hypertension, cardiorespiratory problems and osteonecrosis.

For phase 1 of the project, the goal is to simplify and improve the existing tool for predicting VO2 max in the 
future for patients with ALL.

For phase 2 of the project, the goal is to create an early predictive model of future obesity for post-AFL patients.
