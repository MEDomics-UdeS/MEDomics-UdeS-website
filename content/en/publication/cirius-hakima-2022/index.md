## Summary

  A goal of care discussion GOC is a communication process that takes place in a hospital setting 
  between a clinician and a patient at the end of life. The purpose of a GOC discussion is to determine
  the types of care to be administered to the patient so as not to result in more aggressive cares 
  than desired. Nevertheless, the prognoses established by doctors only gaining certainty over 
  time constitute the main constraint delaying the initiation of a GOC discussion. Therefore, 
  the automatic identification of the patients at the end of life when admitted to the hospital 
  would increase the chances to carry out a GOC discussion on time. In this sense, a model based 
  on random forests [R. Taseen, 2021] which attempts to predict patient mortality in the year 
  following their admission to hospital has already been developed. Although the trees constituting 
  the random forests expose relevant informations about the importance of each predictor, no 
  relationship between the patients can be learned. Consequently, we propose a solution based 
  on graphical neural networks for the prediction of patient mortality in the year following their 
  hospital admission. Thus, the predictions at patient level will be made according to all the 
  neighboring and the results obtained can be explained by consulting the connections of the patient. 
  This graph-based approach would infer relationships between patients and thus add interpretability and 
  performance to a model based on random forests.
