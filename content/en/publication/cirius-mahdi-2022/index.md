## Summary

  Precision oncology is an important field in cancer research as its main goal is to lead 
  towards personalized treatments. The genomic heterogeneity of aggressive tumors usually 
  results in heterogeneous tumor features at the anatomical scale that can be captured using 
  quantitative medical image analysis. This analysis will help make accurate tumor phenotypic 
  predictions. The extraction of the tissues characteristics from medical images is known as 
  "radiomic analysis". In this regard, our team, in collaboration with an international 
  consortium called MEDomics, is developing a Python-coded software called MEDimage. This 
  software offers flexible parameters to ensure a product adapted to the users needs to 
  process medical images (e.g. filtering, cropping) and to extract radiomic features in an 
  efficient way. However, validation of these image analyses remains a major challenge. 
  Therefore, we integrated the procedures established by the International Biomarker Standardization 
  Initiative (IBSI) into our MEDimage software. Our results are compliant with the IBSI. A version 
  of MEDimage has already been released and will be tested by several collaborators to ensure the 
  correct functioning of the package and the compatibility of the user needs with the possibilities 
  offered by this technology. It is expected that this tool made for extracting rich and complex 
  radiomic features will be used to conduct multicentric studies in precision oncology.
