**Description:**

**Speaker:** Nicolas Raymond, M. Sc. student in Computer Science, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, 
  Université de Sherbrooke

**Abstract:** Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most frequent pediatric cancer. Approximately two third of survivors 
  develop one or more health complications known as late adverse effects following their treatments. The existing measures
  offered to patients during their follow-up visits to the hospital are rather standardized for all childhood cancer 
  survivors and not necessarily personalized for childhood ALL survivors. As a result, late adverse effects may be 
  underdiagnosed and, in most cases, only taken care of following their appearance. On the other hand, current care 
  guidelines may also lead to more intensive follow-up than necessary; sometimes causing concern for survivors and 
  increasing costs of care. Thus, it is necessary to predict these treatment-related conditions earlier to contribute
  to the health and well-being of survivors. Multiple studies have investigated the usage of specific biomarkers to 
  predict late adverse effects and consequently provide strategies for better personalized follow-up. In particular,
  one study presented a machine learning model to prevent the morbidities related to the deterioration of the 
  cardiorespiratory fitness. However, no solution integrated the usage of neural networks to date. In this work, we 
  developed graph-based parameters-efficient neural networks and promoted their interpretability with multiple post-hoc
  analyses. We first proposed a new disease-specific VO2 peak prediction model that does not require patients to 
  participate to a physical function test (e.g., 6-minute walk test). VO2 peak is recognized as the gold standard to 
  measure cardiorespiratory fitness, which in turn is a key element for the prevention of late adverse effects such as 
  obesity and depression. Secondly, we created an obesity prediction model using clinical variables that are available 
  from the end of childhood ALL treatment as well as genomic variables. Our solutions were able to achieve better 
  performance than linear and tree-based models on small cohorts of patients (<= 223) for both tasks.
