On the hot and humid day of August 5, 2022, the lab members went on a trip to the depths of the Eastern Townships, 
where the merrymakers first competed in a game of [mini-putt in Coaticook in an old refurbished 
church](https://glogolfaventures.com/). The scores obtained are presented below: unsurprisingly, the team with the
most hockey players won this event with flying colors.

**Team scores**

|    **1**    |  **Guillaume Blain, Martin Vallières, Nicolas Longchamps**  | **172** |

|      3      | Alexandre Ayotte, Mahdi Ait Lhaj Loutfi, Simon Giard-Leroux | 203 |

The merry band of tourists then completed a short hike to the [Parc de la Gorge de 
Coaticook](https://gorgedecoaticook.qc.ca/) and crossed the suspension bridge over the Gorge (fun fact: this bridge 
was for many years the longest suspension bridge for pedestrians in the world!)

The athletes then went to compensate for the calories they burned by going to the [Laiterie de 
Coaticook](http://laiteriedecoaticook.com/), and then ended the day with a few beers and pizza at Martin's house
in Waterville.

Enjoy your vacations dear Martin!
